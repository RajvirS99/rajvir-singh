Unbelievable happenings, we don’t know when they can happen. They just come into our lives and make us completely surprised. Maybe, it’s the rule of nature. I’ve always said that life is full of ups and downs. Sometimes they come in our ups and sometimes downs.

One such thing happened in my life. I’ve found one of the best friends in my life who was with me all the time but never saw it earlier. Maybe, we never saw each other that much. We called each other friends but never talked that much. Fun fact — my pH level with that friend of mine was acidic. But with time, I don’t know when it turned neutral. It just got cleared and voila, I have found it. I’m always amazed to think about it. It’s like I had the door key in my pocket but I was finding it in all other places.

I have always found it unbelievable. Life has decided the things. It’s just that we don’t know about them until the right time comes.

Maybe, this is how it happens. No matter how much we know about it. Life amazes us in its ways. So, I guess we shouldn’t be worried about our situations. We never know what’s coming with this.

Maybe just like mine or any other new way, the acidic pH would have become neutral. Just keep calm and feel every moment of the life that’s happening because this moment will never come again. We are bound to live it once. So, why not feel the beauty of it rather than being sad?
