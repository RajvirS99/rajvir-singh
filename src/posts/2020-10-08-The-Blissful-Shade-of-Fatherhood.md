title: "The Blissful Shade of Fatherhood"
---
Being under the fatherhood gives a great sense of satisfaction. Under a father’s care, the child lives carefree. He fulfills all sorts of amenities in our lives. Raising with a father is like a being a flower of a tree.

A father does all the duties of his child. He becomes our support until his child becomes independent. He makes us walk on our feet. He gives us an understanding of right and wrong. He made us what we are right now. Even after all this, he wishes for our prosperity.

A father is the richest man in the world for his child. It doesn’t matter what he suffers from, he will not let anything happen to his children. Having the shade of such a sturdy tree is a blessing. We should be grateful and proud of having such a great soul. He deserves all his dreams to come true and I would love to fulfill all of them.
