                <p>I am Rajvir Singh from Punjab, India. I'm a Computer Science student from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. As a tech geek, I like to know stuff about technologies. It can be any anything from programming to latest devices. I also love to share my knowledge. I also have a YouTube channel where I like to share stuff I learn.</p>
                <p>Being a Nature Lover, I like to spend time in outside. I love to travel new places and talking to new people. Getting exposure about new places. Sometimes I also like click pictures of world living around me. Fun fact- It can include things as small as snowflake to as big as sunsets.</p>
