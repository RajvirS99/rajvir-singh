Unbelievable happenings, we don’t know when they can occur with us. It just come in our life and make us completely surprised. Maybe, it’s the rule of nature. I’ve always said the life full of ups and downs. Sometime they come in our ups and sometimes downs.

It happened in my life. I’ve found one of the best friends in my life who was with me all the time but I never saw it earlier. Maybe, we never saw each other that much. we called each other friends but never talked that much. Fun fact — pH level of that friend of mine with was acidic. But with time, I don’t know when it got turned into neutral. It just got cleared and voila, I have found it. And I’m always amazed to think about it. It’s like I was having the key of door in pocket but I was finding it in all other places.

I have always found it unbelievable. Life has decided the things. It’s just that we don’t know about them until the right time comes.

Maybe, this is how it happens. No matter how much we know about it. Life amazes us in its own ways. So, I guess we shouldn’t be worried for our situations. We never know what’s coming with this.

Maybe just like me or any other new way, the acidic pH will become the neutral. Just keep calm and feel every moment of the life that’s happening because this moment will never come again. We are bound to live it once. So, why not by feel the beauty of it rather than being sad.
